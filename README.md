# Orbit-Simulation
Science Project for School

This repo was inspired by [This repo](https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Planet-Simulation)

This simulation does not accounted for each planet interacting with each other,
They only orbit the sun, but the sun do orbit another planet with enough mass, > 10e30 kg. 

The simulation is currently using Runge-Kutta 4th order
