# Orbit-Simulation
Science Project for School

This repo was inspired by [This repo](https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Planet-Simulation)

This simulation does not accounted for each planet interacting with each other,
in simple terms The planets do not orbit each other.
They only orbit the sun, but the sun do orbit another planet with enough mass, > 10e30 kg. 
(Don't know why the planets do not orbit each other though👍🏻)

The simulation is currently using Euler Integration,
I am thinking of moving to Runge Kutta though.
